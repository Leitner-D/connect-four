Phase 1: Local Play
Set Up the Project:

Create a new React app using create-react-app or Vite.
Set up the folder structure (e.g., src/components, src/styles, etc.).
Install necessary dependencies (e.g., React Router if needed).
Game Logic:

Implement the Connect Four grid (6 rows x 7 columns).
Create the game logic for checking wins (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
Add functionality for alternating turns between two players.
Basic UI:

Design a simple interface for the game board.
Add buttons for restarting the game.
Testing:

Test the game logic thoroughly to ensure it works correctly.
Phase 2: Hosting
Prepare for Deployment:

Optimize the app for production (e.g., minify assets, remove unused code).
Add a favicon and basic branding.
Deploy Online:

Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Deploy the app and ensure itâ€™s accessible online.
Phase 3: Sounds and Animations
Add Sounds:

Integrate sound effects for actions like placing a piece, winning, or restarting.
Use libraries like howler.js for sound management.
Add Animations:

Animate the dropping of pieces into the grid.
Add subtle animations for winning sequences (e.g., highlighting the winning pieces).
Enhance UI:

Improve the design with CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.
Add hover effects and transitions for buttons.
Phase 4: Multiplayer
Backend Setup:

Set up a backend server (e.g., Node.js with Express) to handle multiplayer logic.
Use WebSocket or libraries like socket.io for real-time communication.
Multiplayer Logic:

Implement player matchmaking (e.g., random pairing or private rooms).
Sync game state between players in real-time.
Authentication:

Add user authentication for multiplayer (e.g., login with email or social accounts).
Testing:

Test multiplayer functionality thoroughly to ensure smooth gameplay.
Phase 5: Final Touches
Polish the App:

Add a leaderboard or stats tracking for multiplayer.
Include a tutorial or help section for new users.
Monitor and Maintain:

Set up error tracking and analytics (e.g., Sentry, Google Analytics).
Regularly update the app based on user feedback.
